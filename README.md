# Shape-Shooter
A little game about shooting shapes:

- This game is programmed in P5.js.
- The player must utilize powerups (which will change shooting behavior) and health in order to attack enemy shapes. If the player's health runs out, they die.
- The game has a count of shapes that must be on the screen at once, if the current amount of shapes is lower than that value, another shape is added. The shape target count slowly increases as time goes on.

IMPORTANT: Before playing, you must download the "sounds" folder for the program to work.
