# Shape-Shooter
A little game about shooting shapes.
This game is programmed in P5.js
The game has a count of shapes that must be on the screen at once, if the current amount of shapes is lower than that value, another shape is added. The shape target count slowly increases as time goes on. The player must utilize powerups (which will change shooting behavior) and health. If the player's health runs out, you die.
